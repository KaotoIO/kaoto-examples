# Kaoto Examples
Hosting example integrations provided by users

# How to use
There are a few ways to use these examples:

## [Red Hat Dev Spaces](https://workspaces.openshift.com/#https://github.com/KaotoIO/kaoto-examples.git)
This is the easiest way to get started with the examples. It also provides a full development environment with all the tools you need to develop and test your integrations.

## [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/github/KaotoIO/kaoto-examples)
This is a lightweight, browser-based version of Visual Studio Code that lets you develop entirely in the browser. It's a great way to quickly check out the examples.

## Clone the repository and run the examples locally
Alternatively, you could clone the repository and run the examples locally. After cloning the repository, you can follow the instructions from [the Kaoto's quickstart guide](https://kaoto.io/docs/quickstart/) to run the examples.
